== Introduction

The I2CEEPROM library provides a synchronous interface for interacting with AT24LC series I2C EEPROM chips (4 KB to 64 KB, e.g., AT24LC256, AT24LC512) on Arduino platforms. Derived from the `StorageBase` class, it supports reliable read/write operations with write verification, optimized for shutdown-time configuration storage in home automation systems. The library integrates with the `Logger` library for error reporting and is compatible with ESP32, ESP8266, AVR, and RP2040 platforms.

== Features

* Synchronous, blocking API for straightforward usage.
* Write verification for data integrity (`writeu8`, `writeArray`, `updateArray`).
* Optimized block writes for fast shutdown-time saves (~10–15 ms for 100 bytes).
* Platform-specific I2C buffer sizes (128 bytes for ESP32/ESP8266/RP2040, 30 bytes for AVR).
* Error logging for I2C issues (e.g., NACK, timeout) via `Logger`.
* Write cycle optimization with `updateu8` and `updateArray` to extend EEPROM lifespan.
* Optional hardware write protection via a configurable pin.

== Installation

To use the I2CEEPROM library in your Arduino or PlatformIO project:

1. Install the required dependencies: `StorageBase`, `Logger`, and `Callback` libraries.
2. Clone or download the library:
+
[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/dynapptor/I2CEEPROM.git
----
3. For Arduino IDE:
   - Copy the `I2CEEPROM` folder to your Arduino `libraries` directory.
4. For PlatformIO:
   - Place the `I2CEEPROM` folder in the project's `lib/` directory or add as a dependency in `platformio.ini`:
+
[source,ini]
----
lib_deps = https://github.com/dynapptor/I2CEEPROM.git
----
5. Include the library in your sketch:
+
[source,cpp]
----
#include <I2CEEPROM.h>
----

== Dependencies

* *Arduino Wire Library*: For I2C communication (included with Arduino framework).
* *StorageBase*: Base class for storage operations.
* *Logger*: For error logging.
* *Callback*: Required by the `Logger` library.

Ensure these libraries are installed before using `I2CEEPROM`.

== Usage

Below is an example demonstrating initialization, reading, writing, and formatting with the I2CEEPROM library.

[source,cpp]
----
// Initialize a 32 KB EEPROM at I2C address 0x50
#include <Wire.h>
#include <I2CEEPROM.h>

I2CEEPROM eeprom(0x50, AT24LC::AT24LC256, &Wire);

void setup() {
  Wire.begin();
  Serial.begin(115200);
  if (!eeprom.isConnected()) {
    Serial.println("EEPROM not found!");
    while (1);
  }

  // Read 100 bytes of configuration at startup
  uint8_t config[100];
  eeprom.readArray(0, config, 100);

  // Write configuration before shutdown
  uint8_t newConfig[100] = {0x55};
  if (eeprom.writeArray(0, newConfig, 100)) {
    Serial.println("Config saved successfully");
  }

  // Update configuration (e.g., from web interface)
  uint8_t updatedConfig[50] = {0xAA};
  eeprom.updateArray(100, updatedConfig, 50);

  // Format EEPROM with zeros
  eeprom.format(0x00);
}

void loop() {}
----

== Configuration Options

* *I2C Address*: Set via constructor (0x50–0x57).
* *Chip Type*: Specify using `AT24LC` enum (e.g., `AT24LC::AT24LC256` for 32 KB).
* *Write Protect Pin*: Optional, set to -1 if unused.
* *Write Cycle Time*: Default 5 ms (`I2C_WRITEDELAY`), adjustable with `setExtraWriteCycleTime`.

== Notes

* *Address Validation*: Prevents out-of-bounds access using `isValidAddress`.
* *EEPROM Lifespan*: `updateu8` and `updateArray` minimize write cycles (100,000 cycles/cell).
* *Performance*: Optimized for shutdown writes, suitable for home automation.
* *Platform Considerations*:
  - ESP32/ESP8266/RP2040: Larger buffer (128 bytes), FreeRTOS support.
  - AVR: Smaller buffer (30 bytes), ideal for constrained environments.
* *Error Handling*: I2C errors logged via `Logger` for debugging.
